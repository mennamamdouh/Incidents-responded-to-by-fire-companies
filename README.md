# Incidents-responded-to-by-fire-companies
This project is about analyzing data of fire incidents and fire companies using Python programming.
The repository contains xlsx and csv files and a ipynb notebook for the results.
The files are:
  1. xlsx file for the metadata of the data that explains each column of represents what
  2. csv file that contains all the data
  3. ipynb notebook that contains all the questions and their answers

In this project, I've used Python libraries like Pandas for exploring the data and analyzing it, and seaborn and matplotlib libraries for the visualization.
